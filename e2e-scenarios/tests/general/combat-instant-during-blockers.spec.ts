/**
 * E2E browser test: activating abilities after declare attackers to prepare for blocking.
 *
 * Spitfire Handler (1/1) can't block creatures with power greater than its own.
 * By activating its {R}: +1/+0 ability twice after attackers are declared (before
 * blockers step) it reaches power 3 and becomes able to block Hill Giant (3/3).
 *
 * Per MTG rules (CR 507/508), declaring attackers and blockers are turn-based
 * actions that happen before priority. Instant-speed actions happen after
 * attackers are declared, before the declare blockers step begins.
